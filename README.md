# Multimodal-Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting-Sentiment-Analysis-and-LLM-Only-Approaches
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks for financial time series forecasting and robustness testing using Apple (AAPL) stock data: Multimodal_Financial_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb and Robustness_Testing_Financial_Forecasting.ipynb.

Project Overview
1. Multimodal_Financial_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb: Compares sentiment analysis and LLM-only approaches for forecasting AAPL stock prices (Apr 1, 2020 - Dec 31, 2024). Calculates technical indicators, fits traditional supervised learning models and deep learning models for the sentiment analysis aproach, and constructs prompts for the LLM-only approach.
2. Robustness_Testing_Financial_Forecasting.ipynb: Follow the same steps as in the Multimodal_Financial_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb. Tests robustness of forecasting approaches for AAPL stock prices (Jun 1, 2024 - Mar 10, 2025). Calculates technical indicators, predicts with the fine-tuned traditional supervised learning models and deep learning models in Multimodal_Financial_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb for the sentiment analysis aproach, and predicts with the fine-tuned LLM for the LLM-only approach.
3. Google News Web Scraping.ipynb: Scrape news with keywords of AAPL stocks for robustness testing.
